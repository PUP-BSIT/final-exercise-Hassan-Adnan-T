        <h2>Future me</h2>
        <p>
          I want to be a person who has the ability to communicate with others
          properly, someone who can help others and make them feel that they are
          not alone. I want to be a person who can express his feelings
          comfortably. <strong>I want to be that person.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I wonder how I will be in the future. Will these skills of mine 
          be enough? Will I ever find something I can enjoy while working?
          Where will I be placed?
        </p>
        <p>
          In these past months, JavaScript (JS) and PHP, among others, entered
          our web development journey. I was confused; I do understand things,
          but when it comes to coding, I suddenly don't know what to do. I
          thought to myself, "I think I'm not cut out for this." The stress and
          pressure are definitely hitting me right now. This is the first time
          I'm feeling this way, where I cried and felt helpless. Is it worth it?
          It probably is, since this is a journey to something new. Do I still
          want to be here? Right now, I need to be; I have to be. I want our
          project to work, thus I will give my best, even if it's not enough; I
          will give my best.
